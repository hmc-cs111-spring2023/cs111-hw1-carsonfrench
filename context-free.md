# Context Free

##  Who is this programming language for?
Artists who want to 2D artwork or designs. 

## What is easy to do in this language? Why is it easy?
It is easy to draw basic shapes because there are prebuilt functions that will automatically draw them. It is also easy to render images or animations because you just click the render button and it appears.

## What is hard to do in this language? Why is it hard?
This language was difficult to learn because there are not many resources online on how to make basic drawings. It would also be hard to draw images that are not made out of basic shapes. For example, it would pretty difficult to trace an outline of someone's silhouette. 

## How did you learn how to program in this language?
I read the documentation online, but that was not very helpful. I learned by looking at the example projects and taking ideas from those. 

## What is the underlying _computational model_ for this programming language? 
_We don't yet have a great definition of the term "computational model". 
For now, try to come up with the clearest, most concise explanation of what 
happens when a ContextFree program runs._
ContextFree takes the code and uses it to draw an image or series of images to make an animation. 

## What do you think is interesting about the ContextFree program you wrote?
I created multiple shapes which I could then place throughout the image in different sizes and positions. I also played with recursively defining shapes to create the nose of my snowman.
